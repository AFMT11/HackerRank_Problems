# Objective

In this challenge, you will learn to implement the basic functionalities of pointers in C. A pointer in C is a way to share a memory address among different contexts (primarily functions). They are primarily used whenever a function needs to modify the content of a variable that it does not own.

# Task

Complete the function void update(int *a,int *b). It receives two integer pointers, int* a and int* b. Set the value of a to their sum, and b to their absolute difference. There is no return value, and no return statement is needed.
- a' = a + b
- b' = |a - b|
