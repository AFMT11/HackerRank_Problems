# Objective

- Variadic functions are functions which take a variable number of arguments. In C programming, a variadic function will contribute to the flexibility of the program that you are developing.

- The declaration of a variadic function starts with the declaration of at least one named variable, and uses an ellipsis as the last parameter, e.g.

int printf(const char* format, ...);

# Task

In this problem, you will implement three variadic functions named sum(), min() and max() to calculate sums, minima, maxima of a variable number of arguments. The first argument passed to the variadic function is the count of the number of arguments, which is followed by the arguments themselves.
